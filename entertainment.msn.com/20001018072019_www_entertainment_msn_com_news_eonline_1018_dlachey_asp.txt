98 Degrees' Drew Lachey Says "I Do"

October 17, 2000
Brace yourself: Another boy-bander, this time from 98 Degrees, is officially off the market.

Drew Lachey wed childhood sweetheart Lea Dellecave in a hush-hush ceremony at a church in downtown Cincinnati Saturday.


Gerri Dellecave, the mother of the bride, told the The Cincinnati Enquirer the two love birds, who are both 24 and Cincinnati natives, have known each other since the fifth grade. Both attended the School for the Creative and Performing Arts, as did Lachey's 98 Degrees bandmates Nick Lachey(Drew's brother) and Justin Jeffre.


Lea Dellecave is a choreographer and onstage dancer for the multiplatinum pop band, known for such pitter-pattery hits as "I Do (Cherish You)" and "Invisible Man."


The wedding took place Saturday afternoon at Covenant First Presbyterian Church. The reception was held at Peterloon, an elegant Indian Hill estate, a source told the paper.


Tracy Schwetschenau, who lives downtown, suspected something extraordinary was happening when she saw eight officers blocking off meters in front of the church Saturday. "It was such an adrenaline rush," she said.


Maybe the nuptual bliss will help quell last week's bad tidings for the chart-topping 98 Degrees, which was sued for $25 million by their estranged handlers.


Top 40 Entertainment and its chief executive, Paris D'Jon, claim the mega-selling boy band cut them out of earnings they were owed after helping turn the quartet into a multiplatinum act. Band lawyer John J. Rosenberg says 98 Degrees' decision to end its relationship with D'Jon and Top 40 was fair.


Meanwhile, Lachey joins a growing list of hunky popsters who have tied the knot this year and shattered teeny boppers' hearts--among them Backstreet Boys Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell. (Um, just to clarify, they married their girlfriends, not each other.)
