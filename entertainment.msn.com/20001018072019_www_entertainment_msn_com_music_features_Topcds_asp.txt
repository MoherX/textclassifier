"Kid A" Goes to the Head of the Class

Judged strictly by the numbers (207,393), Radiohead's Kid A may be one of the softest No. 1 debuts in a while, but considering what this weird, non-commercial album was up against, its chart-topping entry this week is still pretty impressive. Weeks -- no, months -- of industry and critical hype helped the uncompromising Oxford, England art-rockers overcome stiff competition from a trio of formidable rappers -- last week's title holder Mystikal, Nelly and former Geto Boys member Scarface, whose Last of a Dying Breed debuted at No. 7 with sales of 133,972 copies according to SoundScan. Punk veterans Green Day also held their own with their full-out pop album, Warning, which entered the chart at No. 4 with sales of 155,520.

Meanwhile, boomer record buyers didn't exactly flock to stores to welcome back prodigal poet Paul Simon. You're the One, Simon's first true solo album since 1990's Rhythm of the Saints (not counting the 1997 Songs From the Capeman project), moved 55,384 copies its first week in stores for a No. 19 debut. At the very least, Simon can celebrate the fact that he finished one spot ahead of Yanni's If I Could Tell You.

Other notable debuts include Guru's third Jazzmatazz outing, Streetsoul (No. 32), country boy Travis Tritt's Down the Road I Go (No. 51), Robbie Williams' Sing When You're Winning (No. 110), DJ Paul Oakenfold's Perfecto Presents Another World (No. 114) and the Indigo Girls' Retrospective (No. 128).

Next week, look for Jakob Dylan and the Wallflowers to sleepwalk their way into the Top Ten, though a lack of top-notch debuts could end up creating another relatively slow sales week across the board. Consider it the quiet before the storm, however, as Oct. 17 sees the release of a new Limp Bizkit album, with new albums from of U2, the Backstreet Boys and Marilyn Manson coming in quick succession.

This week's Top Ten: Radiohead's Kid A (207,393 copies); Mystikal's Let's Get Ready (187,706); Nelly's Country Grammar (161,083); Green Day's Warning (155,520); 98 Degrees' Revelation (149,525); Madonna's Music (141,211); Scarface's Last of a Dying Breed (133,972); Creed's Human Clay (126,137); Baha Men's Who Let the Dogs Out (102,677) and 3 Doors Down's Better Life (97,903).
