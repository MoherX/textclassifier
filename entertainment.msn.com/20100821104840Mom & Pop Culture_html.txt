Dora the Explorer is 10, and while we normally feel for the parents of children about to plunge headlong into puberty, we're not feeling that right now for Mr. and Mrs. The Explorer.


Instead, we're feeling hope. Hope that Dora grows up to be, well, a little less√Ç ANNOYING.


And while it seems mean to pick on a kid on her 10th birthday, don't feel too bad. Dora is an international superstar. Salma Hayek is coming to her party. And she can be proud of being a force in the education of a generation of preschoolers, as well as being a Latina role model.


This doesn't change the fact that Dora is a cheese grater on the nerves of many a parent. She lives in a creepy world where anything can come alive and offer helpful instructions. Was she exposed to acid in the womb?


Still, Dora's not alone in her ability to irritate. And while we grant that what's annoying to one parent might amuse and delight another, here are our nominations for the best and worst cartoon characters on TV today.
