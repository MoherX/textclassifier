Will Britney Sink Her Teeth into Buffy Role?

Oct 10, 2000 — Rumors are flying that Britney Spears will appear on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. But, according to the New York Daily News, a deal has yet to be made. It seems that Spears is a big fan of Buffy. In fact, when she and series star Sarah Michelle Gellar met on the set of Saturday Night Live last season, Spears told the actress she'd love to sink her teeth into a guest-starring role on the show. Soon after, representatives for the teen pop star began discussing the possibility with the producers of Buffy. But again, nothing has been worked out yet. "They would write whatever [Spears] wants," a source tells the Daily News. "At most, it would be for one or two episodes, but it's still on the back burner as of now."
