How Many Celebrities Can You Pick Out in Sleater-Kinney's 'No Cities to Love' Video?

Who wants to watch rock video after rock video that just shows the band playing their instruments? Not Sleater-Kinney, obviously. We love watching the ladies shred, but this concept is pretty neat too.The girls asked a bunch of their friends to sing along to the title track from their ballin' new comeback album, No Cities to Love. And it's even more non-traditional in the sense that the album version wasn't even used; this is just the squad singing almost a cappella, with a homemade keyboard and a little beat.

The cast of singers includes some SNL-ers (Andy Samberg, Vanessa Bayer, Fred Armisen), other actors and actresses (Sarah Silverman, Norman Reedus, Miranda July, Brie Larson, Natasha Lyonne, Ellen Page) and, of course, some musicians (Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, My Chemical Romance's Gerard Way).

No Cities to Love drops Jan. 20 via Sub Pop and it's going to be a good one. We picked another album cut, "Bury Our Friends," as our favorite rock/alternative song of 2014. Click here for the full list.
