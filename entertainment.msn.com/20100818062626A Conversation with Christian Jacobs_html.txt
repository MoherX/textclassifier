There's a Party in My City! ... and probably yours too! If you know anything about "Yo Gabba Gabba!," you know that the live show is hitting the road pretty soon. Your kids are going to want to see it, and if you grew up during the times of ska and punk, you probably want a piece of the "Yo Gabba Gabba!" action too.

Nick Jr.'s quirky TV series has become something of a sensation, not just for the pre-K crowd it was designed for, but for parents and even high school and college age kids.

Dads and music buffs, Christian Jacobs and Scott Schultz, created their hit television show (in true punk fashion) in the garage, and it's come a long way since then. I got the chance to talk to Jacobs and I ask him what his reaction is to the success of "Yo Gabba Gabba!"

Christian Jacobs: I'm amazed, I'm really amazed. Sometimes in life you have a dream or an idea and you're like, "What if this worked out? Wouldn't it be awesome?" And then "YGG," for myself and Scott, it's like a dream come true. It's very surreal and very amazing, and it's like a train now that's chugging along and it's doing its own thing. It's really strange to sit back and watch it go and permeate the pop culture landscape. It's really, really weird and awesome. It's really awesome. Awesome is an overused word, but I can't describe it any other way! Definitely surprised and pleased and humbled. The dream came true.

MSN TV: What do you think the main reason is that viewers across generations are being drawn in to the show?

I think because it puts you in that happy place. It puts you in that golden age of being a preschooler and discovering new things. I mean, who doesn't have fond memories of that age, getting in the sandbox, making a sandcastle, finding a cardboard box and crawling in it and pretending it's an airplane. That's something that, you know, we all miss and love, and I think "YGG" is a driver's license to get back in that airplane and fly your cardboard box around the room. Also, because the music is fresh, the guests are all current. They're all relevant in some way to the pop culture landscape. So again, it's like some validation that, "Hey, let's be little kids and have fun and be goofy and dance!"

Does it feel like you've arrived when you have a list of guest stars that include some pretty impressive names: Jack Black, Sarah Silverman, Elijah Wood, Mya? I mean, that's the kind of stuff the legendary "Sesame Street" does!

That's really amazing! "Sesame Street" has this long history of doing that and has all the credibility in the world. For "YGG" to be able to get Bono or BeyoncÃ© on it is not really a stretch because it's this tradition. But for this little punk rock kids' show made in the garage to pull in these kind of people as well, it definitely says something about the show, but I think it also says something about those kinds of celebrities, too. All these people all have kids and want to have something to be involved with.
