Gary Sinise Cast as Lead in ‘Criminal Minds’ Spinoff

Gary Sinise has been selected to topline CBS's upcoming "Criminal Minds" spinoff.

The actor will take on the role of Jack Garrett, a 20-year veteran of the FBI, who is in charge of the bureau's top team handling American cases abroad. The potential spinoff series will be filmed as a "Criminal Minds" episode, which is set to air in mid-February.

Erica Messer will write and executive produce the developing project; Mark Gordon and Nick Pepper are also set as executive producers.

The spinoff is produced by ABC Studios in association with CBS Television Studios and The Mark Gordon Company.

Sinise previously starred as Detective Mac Taylor on CBS's "CSI: NY" until it was canceled by the network in 2013 after nine seasons.

Best known for his role as Lt. Dan in "Forest Gump" -- for which he was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor -- Sinise also appeared in "Apollo 13," "Truman," "Ransom," "George Wallace," and most recently, "Captain America: Winter Soldier."

Sinise is represented by Billstein Entertainment Partners and CAA.
