Bill Cosby will perform in Colorado despite planned protests

DENVER (AP) — Bill Cosby is planning to perform in Colorado despite expected protests and a new allegation of sexual misconduct.

The comedian released a statement thanking his "courageous" fans and saying he's ready to perform in Pueblo on Friday and in Denver on Saturday.

He finished his statement with references to his "Fat Albert" character's trademark line and to his 2013 television special — "Hey, Hey, Hey — I'm Far From Finished."

The 77-year-old comedian is facing sexual assault allegations from more than 15 women, with some claims dating back decades. He has denied the allegations through his lawyer and has never been charged.

In the most recent allegation, a model claimed Cosby drugged and sexually abused her at the Playboy Mansion in 2008.
