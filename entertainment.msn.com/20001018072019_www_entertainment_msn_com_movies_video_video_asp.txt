 Toy Story 2
Spaced out: Buzz Lightyear to the rescue.
Toy Story 2

The brilliant John Lasseter and his band of merry elves at Pixar have done it again. Disney's "Toy Story 2," the computer-animated sequel to their astonishing and whimsical first romp, is as giddy and lovable as its predecessor, and a bit more exciting. Whereas the first film focused on the neurotic cowboy Woody (Tom Hanks) and his relationship with his owner, Andy, "Story 2" belongs to Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), Andy's cocky toy space ranger. When a lecherous toy collector snatches up Woody at a garage sale, Buzz, Hamm (John Ratzenberger) and the rest of the plastic patrol must venture to the toy store and rescue their friend. Besides being a visual feast, "Story 2" introduces several engaging characters while attaching new emotional levels to the film's main protagonists, Woody and Buzz. But aside from all the deep analysis, it's also just plain old bounce-around-in-your-chair fun.

Committed

Heather Graham ("Boogie Nights") hits the road in this light-as-air comedy that dances along the fine line between love and obsession. Indie director Lisa Krueger, who made a name for herself with "Manny and Lo," casts Graham as Joline, a newlywed from New York whose husband, Carl (Luke Wilson), leaves town without a peep. Instead of wallowing in self-pity, Joline sets out to find him, tracking him down to a trailer in Texas that he shares with another woman. Graham is an admirable, cheery lead, and Casey Affleck, as her brother, brings real wit and charm to his basic role. But Krueger, who wrote and directed, relies too heavily on voiceovers to move her story along. While several interesting questions are raised regarding marital infidelity, commitment and modern relationships, the film stays near the surface, which is cautious and dull.

The Green Mile: Collector's Edition

Nominated for four Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Frank Darabont's "The Green Mile" is a miraculous but sugarcoated tale of death row inmates and the men who shepherd them through their final days. One inmate in particular (Academy Award nominee Michael Clarke Duncan) has the prison guards baffled, since it appears the gentle giant possesses an improbable healing power. As his date of execution approaches, prison supervisor Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) must decide whether terminating this man's life is indeed the right decision. Darabont adapts Stephen King's best-selling serial novel with care and admiration. He leaves out very few details of the author's exhaustive story, which adds to the film's length. As a result, though, Darabont creates one of the most accurate recreations of a book on screen, and Duncan gives a solid performance in a complex role. This "Collector's Edition" features the sprawling film in its original widescreen edition, closed-captioned and spread out over two tapes.

Legends of the Fall: Special Edition

In 1994, director Edward Zwick ("Glory") assembled an all-star cast to document the struggles and triumphs of a widowed father and his three boys living on the frontiers of colonial America. The result was this sweeping epic, a boundless drama that's gorgeous and primal, stylish yet emotionally draining and always entertaining. Anthony Hopkins leads the cast as Col. William Ludlow, the proud father of Alfred (Aidan Quinn), Tristan (Brad Pitt) and Samuel (Henry Thomas), the youngest. Samuel has taken a wife, Susannah (Julia Ormond), and the family is delighted. But when the boys are called to war, Samuel loses his life, triggering a series of events that pull the Ludlow clan apart and send one of them plunging headlong into insanity. Transferred onto DVD, the film's Academy Award-winning cinematography bursts onto the screen in glorious splendor. Pitt gives a savage performance, and his fellow actors rise to his challenge. The DVD also contains two audio commentaries (one with Pitt and Zwick), three deleted scenes, several featurettes, talent files, an isolated music score and much more.

Rosemary's Baby

Roman Polanski's classic thriller gets the digital treatment, just in time for Halloween. Director Roman Polanski expertly adapts Ira Levin's tale of a young New York couple who find an apartment next to a mysterious but friendly old couple. Guy (John Cassavetes), a struggling actor, eventually warms up to the couple, but Rosemary (Mia Farrow), who's just discovered she's pregnant, is suspicious of them. When Guy's acting career takes off, Rosemary is convinced his good fortune is a result of a pact he made with a coven of witches, and that the child she's carrying is really the seed of the devil. A psychological trip, Polanski wisely holds his cards close to his vest, never letting anyone in on his secret until he's ready. Farrow's descent is genuine. Her face looks more sunken and hollow as the film progresses. A true horror masterpiece, "Baby" transfers to DVD with a "Making of" featurette, exclusive retrospective interviews with Polanski and executive producer Robert Evans, and the film's original widescreen format.
