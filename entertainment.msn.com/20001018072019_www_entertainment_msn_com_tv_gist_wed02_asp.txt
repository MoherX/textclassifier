New Details in Springer Murder Case

Explosive new details have surfaced in the case of a Florida woman who was murdered not long after appearing on The Jerry Springer Show, and the information doesn't bode well for the trash-talk show's producers.

According to the New York Post, new records released by the Sarasota County State Attorneys Office indicate that Nancy Campbell-Panitz was led to believe by the producers of The Jerry Springer Show that she was going to reconcile with her ex-husband, Ralf Panitz, onstage.

But it was a setup. The producers actually had an unpleasant surprise in store for Campbell-Panitz. On the day of the taping in May, Campbell-Panitz, who had spent the previous night with her ex, was met onstage not only by him but also his new wife, Eleanor. The producers reportedly hoped a good fight would break out during the show, titled "Secret Mistresses Confronted."

Campbell-Panitz walked off the stage. She was found dead July 24, only a few hours after the show aired. The 52-year-old woman had been strangled and beaten to death. Her ex-husband has been charged with second-degree murder. Eleanor Panitz was given immunity in exchange for cooperating with detectives.

Among the other details released by the Sarasota County State Attorneys Office: On the way to the airport after the show, Eleanor Panitz, who was traveling with a group of other guests, wished aloud that Campbell-Panitz was dead. Meanwhile, a waitress at a Sarasota pizza place told cops that she heard Panitz discussing the show and saying he would "choke the life" out of his ex-wife. Christine Champagne, Gist TV Staff
