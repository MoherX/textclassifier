Touched by an Angel fans, upset by CBS's decision to pre-empt the Oct. 8 season premiere of the show, flooded the network with complaints Monday. According to the New York Daily News, CBS received more than 1,000 e-mails and countless angry phone calls.

CBS had planned to air Touched by an Angel's opener at 8 p.m. ET, following the broadcast of two football games. But when the second game ran over, the network cut Touched by an Angel from the schedule, choosing to air 60 Minutes and the Sunday movie once the game wrapped up.

"We understand the Angel viewers are passionate, but we didn't think it favored anybody by starting Angel at 9 p.m. and the movie at 10 p.m.," Kelly Kahl, CBS's senior vice president of programming planning and scheduling, told the Daily News.
