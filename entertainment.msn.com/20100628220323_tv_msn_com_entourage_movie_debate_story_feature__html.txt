Is an 'Entourage' Movie a Good Idea?
Two writers debate the issue via e-mail

Mark Wahlberg is too seasoned a movie star for it to be purely coincidence that on the eve of a new season of "Entourage," which he executive produces, he let it slip that there might be a feature√Ç film version of the series in the works. "I think people always wanted [it], and have complained that the episodes are too short," Wahlberg told MTV News. "I think we're going to do it." Wahlberg, who has himself appeared on the show several times, said the series could conclude with certain story lines unresolved, thereby leaving the door open for a film after the show's final episodes air in 2011. And there is certainly precedent for such a move. From "Firefly" to "Sex and the City," plenty of TV projects have transitioned to the big screen. But should it? We posed that question to two of MSN TV's frequent contributors, both major fans of the series, to get their take on whether there should or shouldn't be a feature film version of the popular HBO series.

Vinnie, tell the truth: You're just mad because Vincent Chase is the most famous guy in America with your name, and he's a bit of a douche. Can we say douche? I meant ... dude. The kind of dude who hooks up with Mandy Moore and stars in Martin Scorsese movies, but you know, from the neighborhood, relatable, just like the dudes who will turn out in "Sex and the City"-style droves on opening weekend. Surely if "Gatsby" can earn $37 million in three days, so can "Entourage: A Feature-Length Film Not at All Like 'The Hangover,' Despite What Mark Wahlberg Says About His Cinematic Influences."

Brass tacks time: Like "Sex and the City," "Entourage" speaks, uniquely, to a time (now), and a place (Hollywood), and that rarest of golden gossamer fancies: the everlasting, do-or-die, single-gender friendship. Unlike "Sex," it manages to do so with a minimum of puns. Why shouldn't it go to the big screen?

Diane, nice to hear from you, but I kinda feel bad for ya. Vincent Chase is the most famous guy in America with my name? Then I guess someone should tell Mr. Diesel, no? Furthermore, dudes don't turn out in "Sex and the City" droves for anything other than movies based on Marvel Comics characters. I love "Entourage," which is exactly why I don't want it to jump the feature-film shark. Sure, it'd probably have a big opening weekend, and might even fill two hours better than I anticipate -- especially if Gary Busey returns, playing himself -- but the beauty of "Entourage" is its stick and move, bait and switch, bob and weave 30-minute movieland magic, single-gender friendship stance notwithstanding. Yeah, that's fun to watch, occasionally even more than Ari (but never more than Lloyd), but the show's better when peeking behind the curtain and for Chase chasing some famous tail.
