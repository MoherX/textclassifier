Daisy Dukes for the summer? That's the question many theatergoers will be  asking themselves after watching Jessica Simpson fill out those short-shorts in "The Dukes of Hazzard." And, trust us, they will be  wearing them this summer and you will be seeing them.

It will be just another example of how movies have a tremendous  influence on our fashion choices: Film and fashion are so inexorably linked, we  almost don't notice their trendy sway.  Working as big-screen invitations  to don duds we may have feared or using fashion to signify a character's  quirkiness, movies have contributed to major changes, trends and standards in  hair, makeup and clothes.  

So, to credit celluloid's style authority, we count down our personal  favorite 10 important fashion moments in film. Not the 10 most fashionable  stars, mind you, but 10 outfits that became not only iconic, but in some cases,  standards. To this, we tip our hat.

10. Diane Keaton -- "Annie Hall" (1977)Lately, Diane Keaton has been  lambasted for her fashion sense. Yet there was a time when she was celebrated  for it. As Woody Allen's quirky, eponymous leading lady in the beloved  "Annie Hall," Keaton received kudos (and an Oscar) not only for her performance  but also for her irreverent style. Costume designer Ruth Morley worked alongside  Ralph Lauren to create Keaton's signature look of cheeky, chic menswear. Her  hat, man's tie, shirt, waistcoat and wide-leg pants appeared simultaneously  polished yet just thrown on. More importantly, the look perfectly symbolized  Keaton's New York character -- not overtly feminine, a little daffy yet  wholesome and always up for new experiences (like reading the National Review).  The look became a '70s sensation as women opted for Lauren's masculine/feminine  style, making menswear à la mode. As Annie would say, it was all very  "la-di-da."
