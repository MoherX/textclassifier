‘The Simpsons’ Headed to ‘Minecraft’

“The Simpsons” family will soon be playable characters in “Minecraft.”

Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products has inked a deal with Xbox allowing Homer, Marge, Cart, Lisa, Maggie and 19 of Springfield Elementary School’s characters to become available as part of a downloadable pack in late February.

The pack will be available for Xbox 360 and Xbox One versions of “Minecraft,” with the content pack available for $1.99, and is expected to eventually become available on other platforms, as well.

“Minecraft” is currently one of the most popular games in the videgoame space, with over 100 million downloades since its launch in 2009. In the game, players create their own worlds and characters using digital building blocks, similar to Legos. Given the game’s popularity, franchises have viewed “Minecraft” as a way to promote their films and TV shows.

Microsoft purchased Mojang AB, the Swedish game developer behind the blockbuster “Minecraft” franchise, in a deal worth $2.5 billion, in September.

“We have an active community of more than 17 million die-hard ‘Minecrafters’ on Xbox Live enjoying the wide range of downloadable content on Xbox, and they have been clamoring for us to bring ‘Simpsons’ characters to the game,” said Phil Spencer, head of Xbox.

Gracie Films, which produces the animated series worked with Twentieth Century Fox to bring the “Simpsons” characters to life in the game.

“Like ‘The Simpsons,’ ‘Minecraft’ is a true cultural phenomenon embraced by people of all ages, from every corner of the globe,” said Roz Nowicki, executive VP of global sales and retail for Twentieth Century Fox Consumer Products. “We know fans of the show will have a ton of fun bringing the colorful characters of Springfield into the intricate worlds they’ve been building in ‘Minecraft.’”
