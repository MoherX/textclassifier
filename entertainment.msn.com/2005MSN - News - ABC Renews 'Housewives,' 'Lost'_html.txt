ABC isn't being coy about whether freshman hits "Desperate Housewives" and  "Lost" will be back next year, announcing early renewals for both series.  "Alias" and "Boston Legal" also have been renewed for the 2005-06 season, the  network said Tuesday.

Complete network lineups for the following season, including renewals and new  series, will be unveiled at New York "upfront" presentations in May for Madison  Avenue.

"Desperate Housewives," a comedy-drama about suburban angst, is the top-rated  series of the current season with 22.8 million viewers weekly and ranks fourth  for the season to date among all shows.

The series helped pull ABC out of a protracted ratings slump. The network is  No. 2 in average weekly viewers for the season so far, compared to its distant  fourth-place status at the same time last year.

Teri Hatcher, who won a Golden Globe for her role, stars  along with Felicity Huffman, Marcia Cross, Eva Longoria and Nicollette Sheridan.

"Lost" is winning its Wednesday time slot and is drawing 15.9 million weekly  viewers, making it the 14th-ranked program in primetime, according to Nielsen  Media Research.

The drama about plane crash survivors stranded on a mysterious island  features an ensemble cast including Matthew Fox, Evangeline Lilly, Naveen Andrews and Josh Holloway.

"Alias," with Jennifer Garner as a fetching spy, will return for its fifth  season after improving its ratings this year, ABC said.

"Boston Legal," a reworked version of the canceled "The Practice" with  Emmy-winning stars James Spader and William Shatner, will get a second season after winning its  Sunday time slot among total viewers.
