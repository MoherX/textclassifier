Motley Crue Movie ‘The Dirt’ Revived at Focus Features

Focus Features is reviving Motley Crue biopic “The Dirt,” which was set up nearly a decade ago at Paramount.

Jeff Tremaine will direct from a screenplay written by Rich Wilkes and Tom Kapinos based on the 2001 autobiography “The Dirt: Confessions of the World’s Most Notorious Rock Band” by band members Tommy Lee, Vince Neil, Mick Mars, and Nikki Sixx, along with author Neil Strauss.

Producers are Julie Yorn, Erik Olsen and Allen Kovac. Chris Nilsson, Steven Kline and Rick Yorn will exec produce, and the band members will co-produce.

Tremaine has directed all of the “Jackass” films. Josh McLaughlin will oversee the production for Focus.

Larry Charles was attached to direct “The Dirt” for Paramount Classics in 2006 with MTV Films.

The band is currently on its “final tour” with the slogan “All Bad Things Must Come to an End.”

The news was first reported by the Hollywood Reporter.
