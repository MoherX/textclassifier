Eva Longoria Signs On To Star In NBC’s ‘Telenovela’

The “Desperate Housewives” actress has finally signed on to exec produce and star in NBC’s comedy, “Telenovela,” slated for the 2015-2016 season.

“Telenovela” will be given a 13-episode order, now that Longoria has decided to star in the single-camera project, which goes behind the scenes of a telenovela and its star whose off-camera life rivals the drama of her on-screen storylines.

Bob Greenblatt, chairman, NBC Entertainment, said that the comedy is the perfect fit for the growing Latino audience in today’s television landscape. Jennifer Salke, president, NBC Entertainment, added that they’re in business with diverse talent, commenting, “I think you’re going to start to see a really big change and we’re ahead of the curve…we’re excited about the idea of looking at an all Latin cast so I think you’ll see more of that for sure.”

Longoria teased her return in front of the camera at ESPN’s Television Critics Assn. panel, but as previously reported, she had not yet decided between “Telenovela” and ABC’s comedy developed with “Trophy Wife” creators Emily Halpern and Sarah Haskins, both of which she would have exec produced through her company, UnbeliEVAble.
