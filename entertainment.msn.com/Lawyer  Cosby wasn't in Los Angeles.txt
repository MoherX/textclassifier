Lawyer: Cosby wasn't in Los Angeles at time of alleged abuse

LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Bill Cosby's attorney said Friday that the comedian was not at the Playboy Mansion on the night a model accuses him of drugging and sexually abusing her.

Cosby was in New York on the night that model Chloe Goins claims the comedian drugged and accosted her in a bedroom of the mansion, attorney Martin D. Singer wrote in a statement.

Singer said he would present evidence to authorities detailing Cosby's whereabouts before, during and after the Playboy Mansion event.

Goins met with Los Angeles police detectives on Wednesday and her attorney said the incident took place during an event in August 2008. While many of the abuse claims leveled against Cosby fall outside civil and criminal statutes of limitations, Goins' allegations may fall within the time period that Cosby could be charged.

Goins' attorney Spencer Kuvin said Wednesday that the alleged abuse occurred during an event called "Midsummer's Night Dream Party" on Aug. 9, 2008, at the mansion. Goins does not know what happened while she was blacked out but Kuvin has said she awoke to find herself naked and Cosby over her.

"Mr. Cosby was in New York on that date," Singer wrote. "We will be providing documentary evidence to the appropriate authorities which conclusively establishes Mr. Cosby's whereabouts on August 9th and for the preceding and succeeding days."

In response to Singer's statement, Kuvin questioned whether Cosby was at the mansion that summer. "We look forward to seeing this alleged proof," Kuvin wrote in an email.

Los Angeles prosecutors will make the final determination on whether Cosby will face criminal charges based on Goins' allegations.
