Marlboro Man Darrell Winfield Dead at 85: Wyoming Rancher Was First Authentic Cowboy to Be Face of the Cigarette Brand

A number of men have served as the face of Marlboro cigarettes over the years. But there there were only so many Marlboro Men for the ages.

Darrell Winfield, the Wyoming rancher who was the first authentic cowboy to star in the Philip Morris-owned brand's iconic advertising campaign, has died at the age of 85, CNN reports. No cause of death was given. An obituary posted to Fremont County, Wy.'s County 10 website noted that he passed away Jan. 12.

Winfield was discovered by Philip Morris ad man Leo Burnett in 1968 while working on the Quarter Circle 5 Ranch in Pinedale, Wy., and remained as a face of the brand until 1989. It became illegal in 1998 for American tobacco companies to use humans or cartoons in its advertising.

While at least four of the men who portrayed the rugged, macho Marlboro Man over the years have died of smoking-related causes, according to the Los Angeles Times, Winfield never spoke out publicly against the brand that made him a star.

Asked not long after becoming a household face what life would have been like had Philip Morris never come calling, he famously replied, "Life would have basically been the same."

Winfield started WD/Winfield Horses in Riverton, Wy., in 1974 and never quit his day job throughout his time spent working with Marlboro.

He is survived by his wife of 66 years, Lennie; son Brian; five daughters; numerous grandchildren, great-grandchildren and great-great-granchildren; and his brother Ray Winfield.
