NBC Developing Dolly Parton TV Movies

NBC has signed a development deal with Dolly Parton. Under the pact, the network is planning a series of TV movies with Parton based on her “songs, stories and inspiring life.”

Parton will develop the projects with production partner Sam Haskell of Magnolia Hill Entertainment and Warner Bros. Television. “I don’t know anyone in the world who doesn’t love Dolly Parton, and the idea of developing television movies inspired by her incredible life and the stories she has sung about for decades is exciting to all of us at NBC,” said Robert Greenblatt, Chairman, NBC Entertainment.

Greenblatt recently worked with Parton on the Broadway production of 9 To 5. “We want to create projects for NBC that are both fun and inspirational with a family audience in mind,” she said.
