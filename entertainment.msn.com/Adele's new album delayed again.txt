Adele's new album delayed again

British soul singer Adele has delayed the release of her long-awaited third album.The Someone Like You hitmaker's upcoming record has been pushed back yet again and could even be put on hold until next year (16).

It was originally scheduled to be released at the end of last year (14), after the singer took a break from music to raise her son, Angelo.

A source tells British newspaper The Sun that the latest delay has been caused by Adele's determination to perfect the album before it hits stores.

It has been four years since the release of her last record, 21.
