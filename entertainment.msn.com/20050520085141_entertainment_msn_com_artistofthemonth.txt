Stevie WonderA legendary singer, songwriter and all-around musician, Wonder has a string of mega-hits dating back to the '60s. After a period of relative quiet, a big buzz is building in anticipation of his new album, "A Time to Love."WeezerIn the mid-'90s, Weezer's quirky and endearing alt-pop made geekiness cool, but the humorous approach didn't obscure their very smart and savvy pop-hook craftsmanship. They've only gotten better, as you can hear on their new album, "Make Believe."Aimee MannAimee Mann first tasted fame in the '80s pop group 'Til Tuesday, but found her true musical calling in her solo work, where she has staked a claim as one of modern pop's finest songwriters. "The Forgotten Arm" is her latest.Nine Inch NailsTrent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails are the band most responsible for bringing industrial music to the masses. NIN's pounding electronic beats and Reznor's dark, brooding persona are lyrically tempered by a quiet vulnerability. "With Teeth'' is the eagerly anticipated new album.Toby KeithA hugely popular performer, former oil field worker Toby Keith currently has the Midas touch in contemporary country music, riding a seemingly invincible string of hits. Keith again shows us how it's done on the new "Honkytonk University."
