TNT to Produce Two Pretender Movies

 Oct 10, 2000
 

TNT will air two full-length movies based on the former NBC series The Pretender, which was canceled last season. NBC left Pretender fans hanging when the network axed the show after four seasons. Now they will at least get some closure.

According to a release issued by TNT, the first movie will pick up where the series left off. The second movie will examine the origins of the Centre and explain why capturing Jarod (Michael T. Weiss) is so important to his pursuers.

TNT began running reruns of the series, which cast Weiss as a genius with a knack for assuming other identities, in September. Premiere dates for the films have yet to be announced. Christine Champagne, Gist TV Staff
